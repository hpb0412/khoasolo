# I am Khoa Do

I have **10+** *years of experience* in application development.

My specialty is `Frontend Development` despite of earlier in my career, I am a desktop app developer.

My favorite tech stacks are built up on `React`, `SolidJS`, `Astro`, and `TailwindCSS`.
You can name some of them like `NextJS`, `Redux` (toolkit), `Tanstack's Query`, `DaisyUI`, etc...

I am also efficient with `Vue` (both 2 and 3) and `Nuxt` 3 since they are what I am doing at work.

## Why [`KhoaSolo`](https://khoasolo.com)?

- There is no available <a>`khoado[dot]com`</a>
- It sounds awesome like **`Han Solo`** from **`Star Wars`**

## What else?
