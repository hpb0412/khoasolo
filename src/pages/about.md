# Ok so... it's about me

> In short, **FE** *specialist*, **BE** *hobbyist*

I prefer `Functional Programming` although I was grown up with `Object Oriented Programming` in university

I am familiar with `Docker` and `Docker-Compose` using `Docker Desktop`

I use `Supabase` for relational database `Postgres`,
and `Mongo Atlas` for nosql
