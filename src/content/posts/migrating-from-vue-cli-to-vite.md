# Migrating from Vue CLI to Vite

In this post I will tell you "what & why" I did when migrating from Vue CLI to Vite

## Motivation

At work, I've had some legacy products that started with Vue 2.

Initially, I wanted to move forward to Vue 3. Unfortunately, everything, as it didn't break at this place, would eventually be at another.

Soon, I found the one that held me back was from Vue CLI. And I need a backup plan for it. Eventually, I decided to migrate the root first. It means moving from Vue CLI to Vite.

Next, you will find my notes on what I discovered.

If you want to learn more about this case, skip to the [third section](#tldr---a-snapshot-of-history) which I explain what leads to it.

## My Notes

Below are 8 points that I concluded from this proccess.

Use this section as the hint if you also do migrating like me.

### 1. Choose `create vite` or `create-vue`

- Don't start with `npm create vite`. It is for Vue 3.

- Let's start with `npm create-vue@2`. Remember, we are still using Vue 2.

### 2. Explicit file extension import

In Vite, importing Vue components requires an explicit `.vue` extension.

- You _CANNOT_ do `import Button from '@/components/button'`.
- You _SHOULD_ do `import Button from '@/components/button.vue'`.

### 3. Alias of `src` dir

Vite makes your single alias config available to all supported features.

In my case:

- `<script>` tag and the JS files used `@` as an alias for `src` directory.
- `<style>` tag used `~` instead. (It could be because of any reason from former developers.)

Anyway, I have two options. One is unifying these aliases, and else is adding another.
I chose the first one - unifying them with `@`.

### 4. Replace `process.env` with `import.meta.env`

The simplest solution is to find all instances of `process.env` and replace them with `import.meta.env` ones.

I can make a more fine-grain solution, but I don't think it is neccessary.

### 5. Replace `require.context` w/ `import.meta.glob` or `import.meta.globEager`

I believe most of mid-size and above level projects have this:

```javascript
const req = require.context('./svg', false, /\.svg$/, 'sync')
const requireAll = (reqCtx) => requires.keys().map(reqCtx)

requireAll(req)
```

This code means load all svg files in svg directory and its sub dirs.

If you throw a new svg into this folder, it will be automatically available to the system.

Well...!!! Vite doesn't have `require.context`.

Fortunately, it has `import.meta.globEager`.

I replaced the previous with this one:

```javascript
export const svgs = import.meta.globEager('./svg/*.svg')
```

If you need the async version, here it is `import.meta.glob`.

Use them wisely!

### 6. Testing with `Jest`

Config Jest is a bit tedious. Jest used CommonJS and doesn't have an offical support for ESM. That's why it is a bit counter intuitive.

Anyway, I can switch to `Vitest`, but this will expand the scope of my task.
So I decided to fight one for all - continue to use `Jest` test.

Here is the checklist to bypass the tedious jessy ðŸ˜ˆ :

- [x] You must have `@vue/test-utils` to test Vue components.
- [x] You need `vue-jest` to load Vue into Jest,
      but be careful with the [version matching](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-jest#user-content-installation).
      In my case my `vue-jest` is `@vue/vue2-jest`
- [x] You need `babel-jest` even though your Vite doesn't.
      (It is used to load your ESM tests into Jest's CommonJS code)
- [x] You _absolutely_ need `@babel`'s ecosystem to aid your `babel-jest`.
- [x] You absolutely need `babel-plugin-transform-vite-meta-env` for `import.meta.env`. It is the only tool I found works out of the box.

```json
// package.json
"devDependencies": {
  "@babel/core": "",
  "@vue/test-utils": "",
  "@vue/vue2-jest": "28", // from version matching link above
  "@vue/babel-preset-app": "",
  "babel-jest": "",
  "babel-plugin-transform-vite-meta-env": ""
}
// <empty> version means "just use the latest"
```

```javascript
// jest.config.js
{
  // ...
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.vue$': 'vue-jest', // this NOT work
    '^.+\\.vue$': '@vue/vue2-jest', // this works
    '^.+\\.js$': 'babel-jest',
  },
  {
    globals: {
      'vue-jest': { babelConfig: true }
    }
  }
}
```

```javascript
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: ['@vue/app'],
  plugins: ['babel-plugin-transform-vite-meta-env'],
}
```

### 7. Linting

The only notice is setting the `sourceType` of `parserOptions` to `'module'`.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    sourceType: 'module',
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
  },
  // ...
}
```

### 8. The hidden Yorkie

By de facto, `husky` is the most popular companion of `lint-staged`.

However, migrating from Vue CLI, I found they used `yorkie` internally.

I decided to use `yorkie`. This save me from renewing the configuration, which will add another change into Pull Request.

## TL;DR - A snapshot of history

In the early days of Vue 3, people still used Vue CLI toolset.

Later, Vite came into place, and Vue CLI faded into history.

Then one day, an official announcement has become.

It sounds like:

> Vue CLI will go to maintenance mode. Vite will be in charge.

([Read more](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3-as-the-new-default))

And from that day, I haven't seen any updates for the plugins of Vue CLI anymore.

The approaches from these two tools are vastly different.

With Vue CLI, every integration requires a plugin. You rely on the plugin providers for everything. If you need an upgraded version of the tools/libs in your system, you would wish it was available at the plugin's repo.

If not, you can do it manually, but the cost is high-time consuming for manual integration and the later maintenance effort.

> That is why our plan to jump to Vue 3 from Vue 2 had so many barriers. I depend on two different parties to get what I want.

Vite, on the other hand, provides me with a less configuration solution. It allows me to pick any ones under the list of supported. I install the tool I want, and Vite will automatically detect and apply it. I only need a plugin once I need the extension of Vite's capacity.

With that in mind, I thought:

> What if I can get rid of Vue CLI first?.

It turns out that's a good idea. Moving to Vite, I am free and happy.

## Final words

Phew! It's a long post!

Thanks for reading it!

I hope it will give a useful help if you are needing.
