# Migrating from Vue CLI to Vite

In this post I will tell you "what & why" I did when migrating from Vue CLI to Vite

## Motivation

At work, I've had some legacy products that started with Vue 2.

Initially, I wanted to move forward to Vue 3. Unfortunately, everything, as it didn't break at this place, would eventually be at another.

Soon, I found the one that held me back was from Vue CLI. And I need a backup plan for it. Eventually, I decided to migrate the root first. It means moving from Vue CLI to Vite.

Next, you will find my notes on what I discovered.

If you want to learn more about this case, skip to the [third section](#tldr---a-snapshot-of-history) which I explain what leads to it.

## My Notes

Below are 8 points that I concluded from this proccess.

Use this section as the hint if you also do migrating like me.

### 1. Choose `create vite` or `create-vue`

- Don't start with `npm create vite`. It is for Vue 3.

- Let's start with `npm create-vue@2`. Remember, we are still using Vue 2.

### 2. Explicit file extension import

In Vite, importing Vue components requires an explicit `.vue` extension.

- You _CANNOT_ do `import Button from '@/components/button'`.
- You _SHOULD_ do `import Button from '@/components/button.vue'`.

### 3. Alias of `src`

In my case, the legacy code has:

- `<script>` tag and the JS files used `@` as an alias for `src` directory.
- `<style>` tag used `~` instead. (It could be because of any reason from former developers.)

Vite makes your single alias config available to all supported features.

I have two options:

- 1st: unifying these aliases
- 2nd: adding another alias config

I chose the first one - unifying them with `@`.

### 4. No `process.env`

Solution is to find all instances of `process.env` and replace them with `import.meta.env` ones.

I can make a more fine-grain solution, but I don't think it is neccessary.

### 5. No `require.context`

I believe most of mid-size and above level projects have this:

```javascript
const req = require.context('./svg', false, /\.svg$/, 'sync')
const requireAll = (reqCtx) => requires.keys().map(reqCtx)

requireAll(req)
```

This code means load all `.svg` files in the svg directory and its sub dirs.

If you throw a new svg into this folder, it will be automatically available to the system.

> Cool, isn't it???

Well...!!! Vite doesn't have `require.context`.

Fortunately, it has `import.meta.globEager`.

I replaced the previous with this one:

```javascript
export const svgs = import.meta.globEager('./svg/*.svg')
```

If you need the async version, here it is `import.meta.glob`.

Use them wisely!

### 6. Testing with `Jest`

Config Jest is a bit tedious. Jest used CommonJS and doesn't have an offical support for ESM. That's why it is a bit counter intuitive.

I can switch to `Vitest`, but this will expand the scope of my task.
So I decided to continue with `Jest` test.

Here is the checklist to bypass the tedious jessy ðŸ˜ˆ :

- [x] You need `@vue/test-utils` to test Vue components.
- [x] You need `vue-jest` to load Vue into Jest,
      but be careful with the [version matching](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-jest#user-content-installation).
      In my case my `vue-jest` is `@vue/vue2-jest`
- [x] You need `babel-jest` even though your Vite doesn't.
      (It is used to load your ESM tests into Jest's CommonJS code)
- [x] You _absolutely_ need `@babel/core` to aid your `babel-jest`.
- [x] You absolutely need `babel-plugin-transform-vite-meta-env` for `import.meta.env`. It is the only tool I found works out of the box.

```json
// package.json
"devDependencies": {
  "@babel/core": "",
  "@vue/test-utils": "",
  "@vue/vue2-jest": "28", // from version matching link above
  "@vue/babel-preset-app": "",
  "babel-jest": "",
  "babel-plugin-transform-vite-meta-env": ""
}
// <empty> version means "just use the latest"
```

```javascript
// jest.config.js
{
  // ...
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.vue$': 'vue-jest', // this NOT work
    '^.+\\.vue$': '@vue/vue2-jest', // this works
    '^.+\\.js$': 'babel-jest',
  },
  {
    globals: {
      'vue-jest': { // this one still be 'vue-jest', not the package name
        babelConfig: true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```javascript
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: ['@vue/app'],
  plugins: ['babel-plugin-transform-vite-meta-env'],
}
```

### 7. Linting

The only notice is setting the `sourceType` of `parserOptions` to `'module'`.

```javascript
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  parserOptions: {
    sourceType: 'module',
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
  },
  // ...
}
```

### 8. The hidden Yorkie

By de facto, `husky` is the most popular companion of `lint-staged`.

However, migrating from Vue CLI, I found they used `yorkie` internally.

I decided to use `yorkie`. This save me from renewing the configuration, which will add another change into Pull Request.

## TL;DR - A snapshot of history

In the early days of Vue 3, people still used Vue CLI toolset.

One day, an official announcement has become:

<figure>
    <blockquote cite="https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3-as-the-new-default">
        The New Vue</br>
        Blazing fast, Vite-powered build toolchain
    </blockquote>
    <figcaption>-- Evan You, <cite>Vue 3 as the new default</cite></figcaption>
</figure>

And we have a notice:

<figure>
    <img src="https://ik.imagekit.io/hpb/tr:w-1200/vue-cli-maintenance-mode.jpg?updatedAt=1680314542890" alt="Vue CLI Notice" />
    <figcaption align="center">(screenshot from Vue CLI's official <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/">website</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

Now we have two guys on a field.

The approaches from these two are vastly different.

With Vue CLI, every integration requires a plugin. You rely on the plugin providers for everything. If you need an upgraded version of the tools/libs in your system, you would wish it was available at the plugin's repo.

You can do it manually, but it is awful, and high-time consuming.

> That is why our plan to jump to Vue 3 from Vue 2 had so many barriers. I depend on two different parties to get what I want.

Vite, on the other hand, provides me with a less configuration solution. It allows me to pick any ones under the list of supported. I install the tool I want, and Vite will automatically detect and apply it. I only need a plugin once I need the extension of Vite's capacity.

With that in mind, I thought:

> What if I can get rid of Vue CLI first?.

It turns out that's a good idea. Moving to Vite, I am free and happy.

## Result

Let me wrap the post with a slice of comparison on production environment:
- Vite: `yarn build --mode production`
- Vue CLI: `vue-cli-service build --mode production`

## Final words

Phew! It's a long post!

Thanks for reading it!

I hope it will give a useful help if you are needing.
